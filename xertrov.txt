yes, saving and closing maps isn't exported but the methods are simple enough to copy paste.  
See SaveAndReloadMap function:

WRT accessing, placing, and deleteing stuff: yes. 
Map Together uses such APIs and there are some convenience methods exposed too.

https://github.com/XertroV/tm-editor-plus-plus/blob/master/src/Editor/MacroblockManip_ExportCode.as 
here are all the exported functions. Particularly, GetCachedMapOctTree() can be used to test for specific blocks and e.g.,
find which blocks/items from a MacroblockSpec are missing from a map. 
You can construct macroblock specs, block specs, and item specs from the provided functions.
